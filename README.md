# Financial Fraud Detection & Transaction Intelligence

## Project Overview

An end-to-end financial fraud analytics project combining **Python, SQL, Machine Learning, anomaly detection, and Power BI** to analyse transaction behaviour, identify suspicious activity, estimate fraud risk, and support fraud-investigation workflows.

The project demonstrates a complete workflow from raw transaction data through data preparation, advanced SQL analysis, predictive modelling, risk scoring, and an operational Power BI dashboard.

## Business Problem

Financial institutions process large volumes of transactions, making manual identification of suspicious activity difficult.

This project addresses questions such as:

- What is the overall fraud rate?
- Which countries and transaction channels have the highest fraud exposure?
- Which customers demonstrate repeated or unusual behaviour?
- Are rapid transactions associated with higher fraud risk?
- Which transaction amounts behave like statistical anomalies?
- Can machine learning estimate fraud probability?
- Which transactions should be prioritised for investigation?
- How can fraud risk and financial exposure be monitored through an interactive dashboard?

## Project Objectives

1. Clean and validate transaction data.
2. Engineer behavioural and transaction-level features.
3. Analyse fraud patterns using SQL.
4. Detect unusual transaction behaviour and amount anomalies.
5. Build customer-level ML features.
6. Train and compare fraud classification models.
7. Evaluate models using fraud-appropriate metrics.
8. Optimise probability thresholds.
9. Generate transaction-level fraud probabilities and risk tiers.
10. Build a Power BI fraud-monitoring dashboard.
11. Create a priority fraud investigation queue.

## 1. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

Python was used to inspect data quality, convert transaction dates, and create analytical features.

Features include:

- Transaction year, month and day
- Day of week and weekend indicator
- High-value transaction indicator
- International transaction indicator
- Digital transaction indicator
- ATM transaction indicator
- Log-transformed transaction amount
- Customer transaction frequency
- 24-hour transaction velocity
- Time since previous transaction
- Rapid transaction indicator
- Transaction amount Z-score
- Amount anomaly indicator
- Composite risk score
- Behavioural risk score

## 2. Anomaly Detection

Statistical anomaly detection was applied to transaction amounts using a Z-score.

Transactions with:

```text
|Z-score| >= 3
```

were flagged as amount anomalies.

The analysis compared anomalous and normal transactions in terms of transaction volume, fraud volume, average amount, maximum amount and fraud rate.

## 3. MySQL Data Warehouse

A MySQL database named:

```text
financial_fraud_analytics
```

was created.

Core tables include:

```text
transactions
customer_fraud_summary
customer_ml_features
fraud_predictions
```

The transaction table stores engineered transaction-level features.

Data integrity checks included:

- Total transaction count
- Unique transaction IDs
- Unique customers
- Fraud transaction count
- Missing customer IDs
- Invalid amounts
- Missing previous transaction dates

The final transaction table contains **200,000 transactions** with **200,000 unique transaction IDs**.

## 4. Advanced SQL Analytics

SQL analysis was used to identify:

- Monthly fraud trends
- Country-level fraud risk
- Channel-level fraud exposure
- Customer fraud behaviour
- Repeat fraud customers
- Fraud concentration
- Transaction velocity
- Behavioural risk-score effectiveness

The SQL layer demonstrates:

- `GROUP BY`
- `CASE`
- `HAVING`
- Conditional aggregation
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- `RANK()`
- Window functions
- Customer-level feature aggregation

## 5. Customer-Level Machine Learning Dataset

A customer-level ML feature table was created in MySQL and exported to Python.

Features include:

```text
total_transactions
active_days
total_transaction_value
average_transaction_amount
maximum_transaction_amount
average_transaction_velocity
maximum_transaction_velocity
rapid_transaction_count
amount_anomaly_count
international_transaction_count
digital_transaction_count
average_behavioural_risk_score
maximum_behavioural_risk_score
```

The modelling target was:

```text
1 = customer has historical fraudulent activity
0 = customer has no historical fraudulent activity
```

Direct target-derived fields such as historical fraud count and historical fraud rate were excluded from the predictive feature set to reduce target leakage.

## 6. Machine Learning Models

Three classification approaches were trained:

### Logistic Regression

Used as an interpretable baseline with balanced class weighting.

### Random Forest

A nonlinear ensemble model using:

- 300 estimators
- Maximum depth of 12
- Minimum samples split of 10
- Minimum samples leaf of 5
- Balanced class weights

### Balanced Random Forest

Used as an additional minority-class-focused approach for the imbalanced fraud classification problem.

## 7. Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

Precision and recall were prioritised alongside F1 and ROC-AUC because fraud detection is an imbalanced classification problem.

## 8. Model Explainability

Random Forest feature importance was calculated for both customer-level and transaction-level models.

The results were visualised using Matplotlib to understand which behavioural and transaction features contributed most strongly to model decisions.

## 9. Threshold Optimisation

Fraud probability thresholds from **0.10 to 0.90** were evaluated using:

- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

The threshold producing the highest F1 score was identified as an analytical candidate.

In a production environment, the final threshold would also consider fraud-loss costs, false-positive investigation costs, customer friction, investigation capacity and regulatory requirements.

## 10. Transaction-Level Fraud Prediction

A dedicated transaction-level Random Forest was trained using features including:

```text
amount
is_high_value
is_international
is_digital
is_atm
transaction_count_24h
minutes_since_previous_transaction
is_rapid_transaction
amount_z_score
is_amount_anomaly
risk_score
behavioural_risk_score
is_weekend
```

The model generates:

```text
fraud_probability
model_prediction
risk_category
```

## 11. Fraud Risk Categories

Transactions were grouped into analytical risk tiers:

| Fraud Probability | Risk Category |
|---:|---|
| 0–25% | Low Risk |
| 25–50% | Medium Risk |
| 50–75% | High Risk |
| 75–100% | Critical Risk |

These are portfolio-level analytical categories and are not intended to represent regulatory or production fraud-decision thresholds.

## 12. Fraud Investigation Queue

A transaction-level investigation queue contains:

- Transaction ID
- Customer ID
- Transaction date
- Transaction type
- Channel
- Country
- Amount
- Fraud probability
- Risk category
- Potential exposure

The dashboard prioritises **High Risk** and **Critical Risk** transactions.

## 13. Power BI Dashboard

The final Power BI dashboard provides executive and operational fraud monitoring.

### Executive KPIs

- Total Transactions
- Actual Fraud Transactions
- Fraud Rate
- Fraudulent Transaction Value
- Potential Exposure

### Risk Distribution

A donut chart shows Low, Medium, High and Critical risk transactions.

### Fraud Trends

Daily fraud transaction and potential exposure trends are displayed.

### Channel Analysis

Fraudulent transaction value is analysed by channel.

### Country Analysis

Fraudulent transaction value is analysed by country.

### Investigation Queue

A detailed table highlights high-risk and critical-risk transactions for investigation.
